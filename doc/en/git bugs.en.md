# Compiling with Actions
The extension compilation works perfectly locally. Which is actually strange. Although only from the terminal and not from VSC.

GitHub, on the other hand, despite the formally correct yaml, refuses to work.
By adding `--log-level debug` it deigned to inform me that the code generated by gemini was wrong, because node-version must be 20 and not 18. I wonder why gemini continues to give incorrect information.

After that, however, it generated an error that, according to gemini, informs that log level is not supported. But it makes no sense.
* First it generated a log, incomprehensible, but useful to gemini.
* It also generated a log after changing the node version. A log that in fact informs that that parameter is not supported. Consequently they removed a parameter.

After removing that parameter, it surprisingly compiled. The file generated online is slightly smaller than the offline one. This is due to the GitHub bug that converts line endings without consent.<br>
For the record, the only way to avoid it is to perform a binary copy of the files, but this loses the line-by-line difference manager, as I have already documented at https://federicoboccaccio.wordpress.com/penny-backup/ (in Italian)
